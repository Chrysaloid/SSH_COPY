# SSH_COPY - 1.1.2
Small collection of Python scripts to easily copy files between devices in the same local network. You must set up DHCP (static IP addresses) in your router settings otherwise the scripts won't work as their setup relies on hardcoded (by You) addresses in the shortcuts or wrapper scripts.

## Initial setup
Clone this repo to a folder named `SSH_COPY` or download contents of this repo and extract them to that folder.

Install required* Python packages:
```
pip install termcolor paramiko pywin32
```
*\* - Don't install pywin32 on linux.*

## SSH_SEND.py
Copies selected files (and folders recursively) in Windows Explorer or Nautilus to a folder on a remote machine.

It will open a terminal window that will automatically close if no errors occurred. If an error occurred the window will stay open so you can inspect the error message.

**Basic usage on Windows:**

Create shortcut with the following content (with placeholders replaced) in *Target*:

Using Windows Terminal (recommended):
```
wt --window new cmd /K @echo off && python SSH_SEND.py -u USERNAME -H HOSTNAME -p PASSWORD -r "REMOTEFOLDER" && exit
```
Using cmd.exe:
```
cmd /K @echo off && python SSH_SEND.py -u USERNAME -H HOSTNAME -p PASSWORD -r "REMOTEFOLDER" && exit
```
Put absolute path to `SSH_COPY` folder in the *Start in* field.

You can rename the shortcut and change its icon if you want. It's convenient  to put it in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` folder (or its subfolder) - that way it will appear in *All applications* and you can pin it to the Start Menu for quick access.

**Example:**

*Target*:
```
wt --window new cmd /K @echo off && python SSH_SEND.py -u Hello -H 192.168.0.123 -p world -r "C:\Users\Hello\Downloads" && exit
```
*Start in*:
```
C:\PythonScripts\SSH_COPY
```

**Basic usage on Linux (with Nautilus):**

We provide guide for Nautilus. Set up on other file managers should be similar.

Copy `ssh-send.sh` to `~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts` and replace placeholders in it.

Or open `SSH_COPY` folder in terminal and run `bash setup-file.sh ssh-send.sh`. It should open the copied file in your default text editor so you can replace placeholders inside it.

Then in Nautilus you can select file(s) and/or folder(s) and right click and then `Scripts > ssh-send.sh`.

**Full help output:**

Successfully sent 1 file(s)

Execution time: 0.169 s
```

## SSH_SYNC.py
Copy or synchronize files between folders on remote or local machines.

**This script can work fully locally** if you ommit the SSH authorization details. Then the `-r/--remote-folder` argument ACTUALLY refers to a local folder and only the order of folder arguments matters.

The first folder argument becomes the source folder and the second - the destination folder. So when the source folder is remote files will be downloaded and when the destination is remote the files will be uploaded.

**File transfer only occures if the destination does not have a source file or if the destination is older than the source.**

The `copy` mode is similar to other tools like [`rsync`](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1) or [`scp`](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/openssh-client/scp.1.en.html). The new and unique functionality it provides comes from the `--newer-than-newest-*` options described below.

The `sync` mode is something I couldn't achieve using other tools (that's why I made this script). It aims to achieve a similar effects as if both folders where the same folder in the cloud storage but without using cloud storage and instead using SSH (or not if working fully locally). Simplified it works like this:

1. Get list of files/folders in both folders.
2. Find the newest file that is present in both folders. That pair of files must have the same same and the same modification date.
3. Files newer than that date in one folder are copied over to the other folder if the other folder doesn't have those files or it has older versions.
4. Files older than that date in one folder that are not present in the other folder are deleted.
5. Optionally repeat previous actions recursively.

Good example usage for the `sync` mode is maintaining a synchronized music library on 2 devices (let's call them a stationary **PC** and a **laptop**). Let's say you listen to music sometimes on you PC and sometimes on your laptop. When you do, you like to disocver new music (in any way) then you'd like to download that music to your device. If you did that separately on the PC and on the laptop, your laptop now has music files that your PC doesn't and vice versa. Let's say that simultaneously you deleted an old track, that you got bored with, on your laptop. Now your PC has new files, your laptop has new files and it also has a deleted file. Running this script with `--mode sync` will delete the undeleted file on your PC and copy new files both ways. Now both folers have the same contents.

  -R, --recursive [MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH]
                        Recurse into subdirectories. Optionaly takes max recursion depth as parameter. The source
                        and destination folders are considered as depth == 0 so specifying "--recursive 0" is the
                        same as not specyfying it at all
  -S, --create-dest-folder
                        If destination folder doesn't exists, create it and all its parents (like mkdir (-p on
                        Linux)). If not set terminate the script if the folder doesn't exist

                        time of copy/sync set as their modification time
  -B, --dont-preserve-permissions
                        If set, permissions will not be preserved and instead files/folders will have default
                        permissions set
  -d, --dont-close      Don't auto-close console window at the end if no error occurred. You will have to close it
                        manually or by pressing ENTER
  -b, --fast-remote-listdir-attr
                        If you copy/sync folder(s) containing more than 5000 entries from/to remote location this
                        may be faster. Requires Python 3 on remote host
  -k, --listdir-attr-fallback
                        Instead of terminating the script if remote does not have Python 3, fall back to "slow"
                        listdir-attr. Only applicable if -b/--fast-remote-listdir-attr was set
  -K, --end-on-inaccessible-entry
                        Terminate the script if it does not have enough perrmisions to access any encountered
                        file/folder (local or remote). If not set ignore such cases but print a warning
  -L, --end-on-file-onto-folder
                        Terminate the script if a file is to be copied onto a folder and vice versa. If not set
                        ignore such cases but print a warning
  -G, --sort-entries    Sort files/folders by name alphabetically before copying. Except for making the logs look
                        more familiar it does not have much other use cases
  -m, --mode {sync,copy}
                        One of values: sync,copy (Default: copy)

COPY mode arguments:
  -F, --force           Force copying of source files even if they are older then destination files
  -N, --newer-than-newest-file
                        Copy only files newer then the newest file in the destination folder
  -M, --newer-than-newest-folder
                        Copy only files newer then the newest folder in the destination folder
  -D, --dont-filter-dest
                        Don't filter the destination files/folders WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE NEWEST FILE
```

**Arguments that need more explanation:**

- `--include-*` and `--exclude-*` arguments - They allow for fine-grained file/folder selection. They use only the file/folder name for matching. They use Unix filename pattern matching provided by the [`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) module. You can pass multiple parameters at a time and you can specify those arguments multiple times. Each of these will be checked in order they were passed and first one that matches the given filename will take effect. If the first argument of this kind is a `--include-*` argument by default all files will be excluded. Analogically if the first argument of this kind is a `--exclude-*` argument by default all files will be included. When none of those arguments is specified all files are included by default. I made it work that way as I think it's quite intuitive - if you just `--include-*` something you probably want to just copy that and nothing else and if just `--exclude-*` something you probably want to copy everything except that. Some examples:

	- `--include-files *.mp3` - Only copy MP3 files and nothing else.

	- `--exclude-files  bad-song-1.mp3  bad-song-2.mp3  --include-files  *.mp3  *.flac  *.m4a  --exclude-files *` or `--include-files  --exclude-files  bad-song-1.mp3  bad-song-2.mp3  --include-files  *.mp3  *.flac  *.m4a` - only copy audio files and nothing else but exlude some specific files.

		- If you removed the `--exclude-files *` part at the end from the first example above or the `--include-files` part at the beginning from the seconds example it would not work as expected because only specyfying `--exclude-files  bad-song-1.mp3  bad-song-2.mp3  --include-files  *.mp3  *.flac  *.m4a` would include all files by default as an `--exclude-*` argument is first. Similarly doing `--include-files  *.mp3  *.flac  *.m4a  --exclude-files  bad-song-1.mp3  bad-song-2.mp3` would include the bad songs as `*.mp3` would match them first.

- `--dont-preserve-permissions` - Preserving permissions is only sensible when copying files between Unix machines as Windows has different permission system, incompatible with Unix so this argument has effect only when both source and destination folders are on Unix machine(s).

- `--fast-remote-listdir-attr` - This argument invokes a small persistent remote Python script (which is closed when this script ends) that uses [`os.scandir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) and `stdin` and `stdout` streams to get the list of files with attributes in the remote folder faster than the paramiko's [`sftp.listdir_iter`](https://docs.paramiko.org/en/latest/api/sftp.html#paramiko.sftp_client.SFTPClient.listdir_iter). After some testing using the machines I had at hand (Windows PC, Windows Laptop, Android phone with [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/), old Linux Laptop) I came up with conclusion that in any mode if at least 1 remote folder that will be included in a copy has at least 5000 entries then `--fast-remote-listdir-attr` will make the whole script a bit faster - in a simple test with 5000 files when none of them were copied (because source and destination where the same folder) when connected to myself in cync mode **without this argument the `Execution time` was ~600 ms** and **with this argument set the time dropped to ~350 ms**. If any files would be copied, you wouldn't notice the difference this argument makes but you can experiment as `Execution time` of the whole script is always measured and displayed.

- `--newer-than-newest-*` arguments - This has a niche use case when you want to periodically download files from a server but after the first download you want to delete old files for any reason (i.e. you don't won't them because they are big). After the copy you and the server have the same newest files but you are missing the older ones. With this argument set next time you copy only newly added files on the server will be copied and the older files you deleted locally will not be copied. If you specify both the file and folder version of this argument the search is performormed on both files and folders and the newest entry's date is chosen.

- `--dont-filter-dest` - By default destination is filtered using the patterns specified by `--include-*` and `--exclude-*` arguments and `--*-newer-than` arguments WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE NEWEST FILE. With this argument set that filtering is not performed. Setting this argument, when both `--newer-than-newest-*` arguments are unset, has no effect.

## ~~SSH_GET.py~~
It is similar to `SSH_SEND.py` but it copies selected files on the remote machine to a local folder.

Unfortunately it does not work :( - it is impossible at the moment to get the selected files from Explorer or Nautilus on a remote machine.

But we leave it here in case if we solve the above problem.

Setup and usage is very similar `SSH_SEND.py` so we only put the help print here.

**Full help output:**
